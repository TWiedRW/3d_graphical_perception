### 2D Bar Charts

![Two-dimensional bar charts. Bars are marked with a circle and a triangle; participants must indicate which bar is smaller, and then estimate the ratio of the smaller bar to the larger bar using the slider.](Screenshot_20230214_134328.png)

### 3D Projections

### 3D Printed Charts

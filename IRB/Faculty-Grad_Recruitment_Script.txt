We are currently conducting an experiment which is designed to examine how we perceive and read information from statistical charts represented in different ways.

In this experiment, you will answer some questions relating to statistical charts.
You will be asked to estimate some numerical quantites relating to the charts you are shown.
Some of these charts will be shown in the web browser; for other questions, you may be asked to reference a specific color of 3D-printed chart.
You should have been given a set of 3D-printed charts for this purpose.

By participating in this experiment, you will help us understand how different types of statistical charts are read and understood.
You will also help us replicate an experiment performed in the 1980s to see if the results still hold with modern graphics and technology.
Your responses will be anonymous and there is no risk to you for participating. You will not be paid for participating in this experiment.

The experiment will consist of 15 questions, plus some limited demographic information that we will use to describe the participants in our experiments. We expect that it will take at most 20 minutes to complete.

You can participate in this experiment by going to <url>. 

Thank you for your help!

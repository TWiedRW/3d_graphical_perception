## Stat 218 Project Description

- Timing: Provided on Canvas at the start of the course or when the class project is introduced to the class

- Document: Canvas-0-Project_Description.pdf

## Project Components

### Informed Consent

- Timing: Completed on Canvas in the first 2 weeks of the semester (ideally) or before the project is introduced

- Document: Canvas-1-Informed_Consent.pdf

### Pre-Study Reflection

- Timing: Completed on Canvas prior to participating in the graphics experiment.

- Document: Canvas-2-Pre_Experiment_Reflection.pdf

### Graphics Experiment


#### Canvas Announcement

- Timing: Ideally, about 4 weeks into the semester (but timing may vary based on class scheduling)

- Announcement:    

> As part of our project, you will be asked to participate in an experiment in Statistical Graphics that will help you experience the process of scientific investigation in a new way. In order to complete the first part of the project, you must find a time to attend Stat 218 office hours, either on City campus or East campus. The statistical graphics task should take about 20 minutes to complete, but you can feel free to ask questions of a TA while you are there. At the end of the experiment, you will be given a completion code that you will submit as the assignment answer on Canvas. 

> Note that your participation in the **research study** is voluntary - you do not have to allow your data to be recorded for this project. You do, however, have to complete the tasks that are part of the research study, because these tasks will give you a better understanding of the research process and will be important to complete the reflections throughout the rest of the project.

> Once you have completed the tasks in the graphics experiment (whether you participate in the research study or not) you will be given a unique completion code that can be entered into the Canvas assignment to show that you have completed the experimental tasks.

> You must complete this assignment by \<deadline\>. If you cannot find a time to attend office hours during this time period, please contact your instructor to schedule an in-person appointment.

#### Experiment Instructions
(provided on a printed sheet of paper)

> The experiment will consist of 15 questions, plus some limited demographic information that we will use to describe the participants in our experiments. We expect that it will take at most 20 minutes to complete.

> You need a bag of 3d-printed charts (provided by an instructor) to participate in this experiment.

> You can participate in this experiment by going to \<url\> on your laptop, or by using the laptop provided by the experimenters, if it is not currently in use.

#### Experiment Participation

- Timing: Approximately 4-6 weeks into the semester

- Document: Graphics-Experiment-Walkthrough.pdf

#### Canvas Experiment Participation

- Timing: Approximately 4-6 weeks into the semester

- Document: Canvas-3-Experiment_Participation.pdf

### Post-Study Reflection - Graphics Experiment Purpose

- Timing: Completed on Canvas after participating in the graphics experiment, ideally after the class has covered Chapter 4 of Introduction to Statistical Investigations, which introduces the concepts of randomization and experimental control. Ideally about 7 weeks into the semester.

### Abstract Reflection - Reading Information in Scientific Contexts

- Timing: Completed on Canvas after Week 9 of the semester

- Additional materials: Students will be provided with a 2-page extended abstract (example attached) discussing the experiment they participated in from a scientific perspective.

- Document: Canvas-5-Abstract_Reflection.pdf

### Presentation Reflection - Consuming Scientific Information

- Timing: Completed on Canvas after Week 12 of the semester

- Additional materials: A recording (or live presentation) of a 10-15 minute research talk describing the results of the study they participated in.

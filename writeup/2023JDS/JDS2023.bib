abstract = {This study considered the interplay of simple versus perspective graphical information on aesthetic preference, instructional effectiveness, and retention. Students in an introductory U.S. government course were presented with examples of 2-D and 3-D graphs and asked to choose which was pleasing to the eye and which was most useful in answering questions about the graph's content. The results of this study indicated that when visual appeal was the only criterion, subject choices overall were approximately evenly matched. When subjects were required to extract information from graphs, they used simple graphs almost 3 times more often than elaborate graphs. Information drawn from bar and circle graphs was extracted more accurately than the other three types of graphs.},

During its life, Excel has undergone a number of different transformations to become the powerful spreadsheet software that we know and love today.   Driven by our love for Microsoft Excel,},

	abstract = {Effective visualization is the best way to communicate information from the increasingly large and complex datasets in the natural and social sciences. But with the increasing power of visualization software today, scientists, engineers, and business analysts often have to navigate a bewildering array of visualization choices and options.  This practical book takes you through many commonly encountered visualization problems, and it provides guidelines on how to turn large datasets into clear and compelling figures. What visualization type is best for the story you want to tell? How do you make informative figures that are visually pleasing? Author Claus O. Wilke teaches you the elements most critical to successful data visualization. Explore the basic concepts of color as a tool to highlight, distinguish, or represent a value Understand the importance of redundant coding to ensure you provide key information in multiple ways Use the book’s visualizations directory, a graphical guide to commonly used types of data visualizations Get extensive examples of good and bad figures Learn how to use figures in a document or report and how employ them effectively to tell a compelling story},

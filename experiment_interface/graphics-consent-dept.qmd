## Overview

**Purpose**: The purpose of this research is to understand how we perceive statistical graphics and how accurately we can read information from charts represented in different ways.

**Time**: This survey should take less than 20 minutes to complete.

**Eligibility**: You may participate in this research if you are at least 19 years old.

**Risks and Benefits**

- There are no risks to participation in this research.

- Society may benefit by understanding how people read and use charts and data, which will help scientists communicate better with the general public.
- Society will benefit by understanding how responses to this study may have changed in the past 40 years; this study is a replication of Cleveland & McGill's study in the 1980s on graduate students and professors in a statistics department and their spouses.

## Data and Privacy
